**Objective**

1. **Evaluating the Performance of Superhost Status:**
   - Understanding the impact of Airbnb's superhost status on revenue generation.
   - Analyzing superhost revenue trends and comparing average revenue between superhosts and non-superhosts.
   - Conducting exploratory data analysis to propose changes to the superhost program for increased monetary value.

2. **Tract Level Analysis for Average Bookings:**
   - Analyzing factors affecting average bookings at the tract level.
   - Utilizing a linear regression model with polynomial terms and significant variables to identify factors influencing booking rates.
   - Providing hosts with actionable insights to optimize listings for increased bookings.

**Findings and Recommendations**

1. **Superhost Program Evaluation:**
   - The analysis suggests that the current superhost criteria may not significantly increase booking numbers or provide notable benefits at the individual host level.
   - Recommendations include restructuring the superhost program to offer tangible monetary benefits, incentivizing hosts to achieve and maintain superhost status, leading to increased overall bookings.

2. **Tract Level Booking Analysis:**
   - Factors such as the number of hosts in a tract and interaction terms related to superhosts significantly affect booking numbers.
   - Recommendations include strategic decision-making for hosts in setting prices and choosing locations for listings.

**Conclusion**

While the current superhost system may not offer significant advantages, the project proposes revising it along with implementing data-driven strategies to assist hosts in maximizing bookings and revenue. The ultimate goal is to provide a more profitable and efficient platform for hosts and a better, more reliable service for guests.
